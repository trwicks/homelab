## Using the command line

Being comfortable with the commandline using either a linux shell and powershell will serve you well in performing a variety of tasks in different computing environments. 

I would say that the command line is very necessary if you want to easily record of how you achieved some task as you can copy and paste the commands into a wiki. And so often I have fondly remembered other admins and developers how have left well explained commands in a wiki that have worked near perfectly a few years after they were initially written.
